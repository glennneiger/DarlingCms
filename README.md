The Darling Content Management System (Darling CMS) was created by Sevi Donnelly Foreman.
Official development began on 01/22/2017.

The Darling CMS aims to provide a flexible web development architecture built on a solid set of
core components that serve to aide in development process without assuming to much about implementation.

Through custom apps and themes developers will be able to extend and style the Darling CMS however they like.

The core API will define some useful interfaces, abstract classes, and concrete classes designed aide
in the development of apps and themes.

The Darling CMS aims to be standards compliant, and to provide a core whose code is simple and S.O.L.I.D.
in design.
